                    shall be applicable, in addition to our Terms and Conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you reserve or purchase travel services through akbartravels.com, we must provide certain of your personal information to the airline, hotel, car - rental agency, travel agency or other involved third party to enable the successful fulfillment of
                    your travel arrangements. The services are provided by independent entities that own or operate airlines, surface transportation, hotels, cruises, etc. Though we select reputed suppliers after we inspect their infrastructure, however,
                    we have no direct control over such services or persons providing such services or their staff. In case of third party products displayed on our website, we take no responsibility for the texts, quality or safety of the product in
                    any way.Â Akbar Online Booking Co. Pvt. Ltd.Â would not be in any way liable or responsible for any loss, damage or injury sustained by the User as a result of availing such products and services advertised by third parties on the website.
                    However, in case a client is not satisfied with a particular service, we can take up the matter with the supplier if we are intimated immediately as per the process described in this document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we book services in advance and are bound to honour the commitments as to payment to the suppliers, cancellation of services earmarked results in the Company losing money depending upon the time of communication of cancellation to the supplier and
                    therefore, the cancellation schedule, which is based on the above amongst other factors becomes applicable on cancellation.
